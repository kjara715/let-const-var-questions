var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

In ES2015 should write as:
const PI=3.14;

What is the difference between var and let?

var used to be the only way to declare a variable in javascript before let 
was created. One difference between the two is their scope. Var is scoped to
function while let is block scoped (more restrictive). Var and let can both be 
reassigned, however only var can be redeclared.

What is the difference between var and const?

In terms of scope, const is block-scoped while var is only function scoped.
Var can be both reassigned and redeclared, while with const, you can do neither.
Const can be mutated however if not initialized as a primitive (ex: arrays, objects).

What is the difference between let and const?

They are both block-scoped, and both cannot be redeclared. The key differece is
that let can be reassigned while const cannot be. Additionally, let can declare a 
variable without being "initialized" with a value while const must be declared with
an initial value.

What is hoisting?

Hoisting is a way that JavaScript reads or is aware of code as it runs. I think of it
as hoisting something from lower down in a script to the top. This is what happens when 
declaring a variable with var. Through hoisting, a variable made with var is declared no matter
how far down it is in the script. However it is not initialized (given its value) until after getting
to that line of code reading from top to bottom. Variables created with let and const are not hoisted.
